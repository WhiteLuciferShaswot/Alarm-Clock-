# Alarm-Clock-
I made this Alarm Clock By Using Html and JavaScript.





Problem Statement:-

The task you have to do is to create an alarm clock in JavaScript (Use your creativity). The Alarm app should allow the user to set the alarm for a certain time. 

To add the audio, search “how to
play audio in js” on google, most probably you will find the code from stack overflow. Or you can use the following code:


var audio = new Audio('https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/examples/t-rex-roar.mp3');

audio.play();
